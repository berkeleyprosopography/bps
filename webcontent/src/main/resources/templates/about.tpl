<h3>About BPS</h3>
<p>Berkeley Prosopography Services (BPS) is exploring and developing a prototype application to build prosopographical 
models that support research.

</p>

<p>BPS was originally created 
at the University of California, Berkeley as a collaboration between the University's <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/">Research IT</a> unit and the <a href="http://neareastern.berkeley.edu/">Near Eastern Studies Department</a>.&nbsp;

An article about the project has just been published in Berkeley's iNews:

and Social Network Analysis to study ancient Babylonian society</a>.</p>
