<p style="text-align: justify;">Berkeley Prospography Services (BPS) grew out of an ambitious exploration on the UC Berkeley campus into the feasibility of building reusable, extensible digital tools for humanities research. Over the course of several campus workshops in 2007, Professor <a href="http://nes.berkeley.edu/Web_Veldhuis/index.html" target="_blank">Niek Veldhuis</a> and Patrick Schmitz discussed the possibility of applying algorithms of probabilistic reasoning to workflows familiar to scholars engaged in prosopographical research, who routinely pose questions such as "How likely is it that two instances of the name 'Bob' refer to the same individual?" when they are studying the social, economic, intellectual communities preserved in textual records.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Veldhuis invited Laurie Pearce, his colleague in Berkeley's Department of Near Eastern Studies, to create a digital corpus of cuneiform texts to serve as a development corpus with which to explore the potential of BPS to support humanities research.  That corpus, ~500 cuneiform legal texts from Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq), contains many name instances and preserves examples of a naming pattern, papponymy (naming an individual for a grandfather), that leads to many repetitions of a limited inventory of names.  As a result, it is often difficult to determine whether two mentions of a name refer to the same individual.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conversation, Veldhuis, Schmitz, and Pearce articulated rules that Pearce applied, seemingly automatically, as she reads a text and attempts to disambiguate namesakes in individual persons. These conversations led to the conclusion that each prosopographer develops a rule set specific to that corpus, and that a toolkit could be developed that utilized rules familiar to each researcher.  This would lead to the development of a corpus-agnostic toolkit that didn't force researchers to conform to an external research framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A series of workshops followed to which we invited researchers working with cuneiform text corpora from a number of different time periods, and which preserved different naming patterns.  Our outreach to other specialists in cuneiform studies was predicated on the idea of building research communities from a foundation of shared interests and common methdologies.  As BPS has matured, we have included papyrologists and classicists in our community of partners; we expect that researchers in fields chronologically removed from the ancient world will find value in BPS as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BPS soon attracted the attention of some of the leading supporters of humanities research, and has received <a href="http://berkeleyprosop.digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/funding/" target="_blank">support</a> from campus and national organizations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012-2013, Davide Semenzin served as an intern on BPS, developing the SNA visualization component. The work he did on BPS served as the core of his <a href="https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/282685">Master's thesis</a> at the University of Utrecht.  Davide returned to the BPS team in 2015 as a core developer.</p>
