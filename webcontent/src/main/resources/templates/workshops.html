<p><strong>UCB-LMU Workshop</strong></p>
<p>July 7-10, 2018</p>
<p>Members of the BPS team (Laurie Pearce, Patrick Schmitz, Niek Veldhuis) and students from UC Berkeley (NES graduate students Gil Breger and Jason Moser; UC Berkeley undergraduate Joanne Tan) joined LMU (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich) colleagues Karen Radner, Jamie Novotny, Nathan Morello in assessing the applicability and utility of various digital tools in assessing the reproducibility of the heuristics and assertions made in a 1993 publication of <a href=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002893654>letters from Assyrian scholars</a> to the king. Moser and Morello explored possibilities for evaluating assertions about distinctive paleographic practices proposed to identify specific scribes. Veldhuis and Novotny utilized SNA to broaden and refine identifications of actors in the royal circle. Pearce, Breger, and Tan reassessed  methodological process and assumptions made about the astronomical data referenced in the Assyrian scholarly letters as tools for dating the letters and royal chronology.

<p><strong>UCB-LMU Workshop</strong></p>
<p>September 9-11, 2017</p>

<p>This workshop, funded by <a href="http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/about_lmu/international_net/coop_excellent/berkeley/index.html">LMU-UC Berkeley Research in the Humanities</a>, brought together researchers from Berkeley and the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich (LMU) to explore the potential for BPS to contribute to the study of Neo-Assyrian prosopography.  As the <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/pnao/">prosopography of the Neo-Assyrian </a> period (c. 900-600 BCE) is well established, the participants determined that future collaborations would explore a innovative, if indirect, application of the BPS probabilistic model of reasoning over assertions and heuristics applied in the analysis and chronological sequencing of <a href=http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/"> letters and reports to the Neo-Assyrian kings</a>.</p>


<p><strong>BPS Matrix Workshop</strong></p> 
<p>April 28-29, 2016</p>
<p>The BPS Matrix Workshop, generously funded by the <a href="http://matrix.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UC Berkeley Social Science Matrix</a>, included visiting research partners <a href=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/about/who/bridgetAlmas>Bridget Almas</a> (Perseus project); <a href=https://www.bradley.edu/academic/departments/history/faculty/profile.dot?id=0f5e3ad7-575b-4c0d-87e2-4a902394bbc5>John Nielsen</a>, <a href=https://www.bradley.edu/academic/departments/csis/faculty/profile.dot?id=474888da-7aa8-40e9-832a-95f58afe28d7>Tachun Lin</a> (Neo-Babylonian prosopography, Bradley University), <a href=https://www.ncl.ac.uk/hca/staff/profile/micaelalangellotti.html#background>Micaela Langellotti</a> (Grapheion archive).
