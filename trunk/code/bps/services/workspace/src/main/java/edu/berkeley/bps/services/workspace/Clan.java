/*
 * TODO Need to model the links from this Person to other Persons, docs, etc.
 * 1) Links to docs (nrad instances) that are associated to this person by virtue
 *    of original citation (for the Person created directly for an nrad) or after
 *    collapse operations (when weight is shifted to other Persons, and so to their
 *    original citing doc/nrad).
 * 2) Links to family relations
 *    a) father as declared, or as shifted to others
 *    b) sons as declared, or as shifted to others
 *    c) Clan?? Perhaps not, or...?
 *    d) (later) co-occurring principals and witnesses, with activity and role type
 *    Note: we do not link to grandfather, but only link to the father,
 *    		who in turn links to the grandfather?
