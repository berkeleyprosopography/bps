<h1><br> Welcome to BPS!</h1>

<p class="intro">There's some background on the project on our
<a href="/about">About</a> page, and links to the related project homes are in the
footer, below.</p>

<p class="intro">This site and the tools are still under development, but you are
welcome to look around and see what's here. You can register for a basic account,
with read-only access. Or, if you just want to browse a little, you can login in 
as &quot;Reader&quot; using the password &quot;reader&quot;
to get read-only access (surprise!).</p>

<p class="intro">If you want to work with BPS with your corpus, you'll need to ask for more access.
If you know either of <a href="/about">Laurie or Patrick</a>, just send us an email with a
description of your interest and any corpora you are working on, and we'll
create a login for you. You can also contact us using the
<a href="/contact">Contact Us</a> page.</p>

<p class="intro">If you click on the Corpora link in the main navigation bar,
you will see a list of the corpora that have been added. Once you are a
registered user, you'll have a workspace as well, where you can import a
corpus, configure the parameters and rules for our disambiguation engine,
and see BPS in action!</p>

<p class="intro">Thanks for visiting. </p>
