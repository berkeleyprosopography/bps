<h3>About BPS</h3>
<p>Berkeley Prosopography Services (BPS) is exploring and developing a prototype application to build prosopographical 
models that support research. The prototype focuses on a corpus of cuneiform 
tablets transcribed into Babylonian.

For more information, see the <a href="https://wikihub.berkeley.edu/display/istds/Berkeley+Prosopography+Services+Wiki+Home">project wiki pages.</a> 
</p>

<p>BPS was originally created 
at the University of California, Berkeley as a collaboration between the University's <a href="http://ist.berkeley.edu/ds/">IST/Data
Services</a> group and the <a href="http://neareastern.berkeley.edu/">Near Eastern Studies Department</a>.&nbsp;

An article about the project has just been published in Berkeley's iNews:

and Social Network Analysis to study ancient Babylonian society</a>.</p>
