  <h2>Examples of visualizations in non-digital prosopography projects</h2>
  <p>Diagrams like these are used regularly by humanists and fulfill an important function in
    supporting a narrative. However, they are also incredibly static, do not reflect the uncertainty
    factors in disambiguating namesakes and do not allow any adjustment or "what-if" scenarios.</p>

    <p class="figcaption">Figure A: Hand-written Family Tree (a: “Ron doesn’t have him”; b: “only in
      patronymic”; c: “Ron doesn’t put this so late”)</p>
  </figure>
  <p><a href="#FigureA">Figure A</a> shows a typical hand-written visualization of a family tree,
    including notes that reflect differences in versions or interpretation among researchers.</p>

    <img src="/images/Ossendrijver%20Diag.png"/>
    <p class="figcaption">Figure B. Printed diagram of network relations</p>
  </figure>
  <p>The diagram in <a href="#FigureB">Figure B</a> illustrates that teacher-student relations in
    Hellenistic Uruk crisscross family lines. Many of the individuals depicted in <a href="#FigureB"
      >Figure B</a> also appear in <a href="#FigureA">Figure A</a>. However, in the print form it is
    impossible to explore the connections between these two views.</p>
