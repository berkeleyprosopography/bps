1) Check out all the source to your local environment.
2) Get a slice, and install Apache and Tomcat. Ensure that php, PEAR, MDB2,
   and HTTP/Request2 (which requires Net_URL2) are installed.
3) Install mod_jk, and configure it to forward bps services calls to Tomcat. 
   For older Tomcat, you may be able to use the auto-config feature of Tomcat
   to do this. For recent (6.x) versions of Tomcat, you need to remember to
   put your JkMount directives in the configuration for your VirtualHost.
   If you are only using the default VirtualHost, then edit
    /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
   to add the JkMount directives. 
4) Copy the content under .../trunk/webcontent to the web root. 
   This should be changed in fugure to build another war that is expanded
   and served by Apache
5) Adjust the .../trunk/webcontent/config.php file to point to your db, etc.
6) Adjust the paths in .../trunk/webcontent/config.php and 
   .../trunk/webcontent/libs/env.php to reflect the installation directories.
7) Currently must adjust the web.xml file and rebuild to set the data source. 
   May be able to specify a Context for the web app that overrides the 
   default param values. Try this. See also:
